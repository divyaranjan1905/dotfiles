** Problem
Out of the box StumpWM provides tools to navigate windows only within
group bounds - "windowlist" function seems to be the main, and maybe
only useful here. But sometimes the user wants to manage or even
simply overview *all* application windows present in X session.

So, this contrib extension was written with purpose of providing the
way to manage global windows list in rather straightforward manner.

** Usage
Add this to your =.stumpwmrc=:

Load contrib module:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (load-module "globalwindows")
#+END_SRC

And then use functions for global windows navigation:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "M-1") "global-windowlist")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "M-2") "global-pull-windowlist")
#+END_SRC

Moreover there is a couple of util functions exported for the aim of
user-defined extensions - see source code.
