* stump-lock

This module allows you to lock your screen while away from your
keyboard.

Note: this is *not* a _secure_ screenlocker. It is a convenient
one. The threat it is protecting against is your cat, not your hacker
neighbor.

** Requirements

None. This is done natively.

** Usage

Put the following in your =~/.stumpwmrc=:

#+begin_src lisp
  (load-module "stump-lock")
#+end_src

And you need to define a password:

#+begin_src lisp
  (setf stump-lock:*password* "my super secret password")
#+end_src

You can now bind the =lock-screen= command to a key:

#+begin_src lisp
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "s-l") "lock-screen")
#+end_src

That's it!
