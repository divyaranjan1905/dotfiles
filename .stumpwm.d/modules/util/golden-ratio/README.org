** Commentary

When working with multiple windows in a single frame, things can get small and, sometimes, a bit messy.
This modules add automatic resizing of your focused frame according to the golden ratio, calculated using the head's height and width.

This module was heavily inspired by emacs's [golden ratio](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el) module.

** Usage

Just add the following line to your .stumpwmrc file:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "swm-golden-ratio")
#+END_SRC
...and then simply enable golden-ratio-mode with:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(swm-golden-ratio:toggle-golden-ratio)
#+END_SRC

Turning the golden-ratio-module on will enable automatic resizing of the focused frame. Enjoy

** Tasks
