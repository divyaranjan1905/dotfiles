** Usage

Put:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "alert-me")
#+END_SRC

In your =~/.stumpwmrc=, and the =alert-me-at= command will be available.

** Example

Run =C-t :=, type =alert-me-at=, then =18=, =52=, =meeting with
foo=. At 18:52, stumpwm will remind you 3 times every 10 seconds that
you have a meeting with foo.

The remainder 3 times is because stumpwm might hide the message if
you're switching between windows.
