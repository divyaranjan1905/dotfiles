* Problem

After  quiting StumpWM,  your  shell command  history  is gone.   This
simple plugin  saves the lisp ~stumpwm::*input-shell-history*~  to the
contents of  special variable  ~*shell-command-history-file*~ (default
to:  ~~/.stumpwm.d/shell-history~) and  loads it  again when  starting
StumpWM.

** Usage
Add this to your ~.stumpwmrc~ (your main configuration file):

Load contrib module:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (load-module "shell-command-history")
#+END_SRC

You can customize the shell history file's path:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (setf shell-command-history:*shell-command-history-file*
        "/home/cage/.cache/stumpwm/shell-command-history")
#+END_SRC
