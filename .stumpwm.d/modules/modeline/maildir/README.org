** Usage
   Put:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (load-module "maildir")
   #+END_SRC
   into your =~/.stumpwmrc=
   
   Then you can use =%D= in your mode line format. You can customize the
   modeline format =*maildir-modeline-fmt*=. The relevant format options
   are:
   | Option | Description                               |
   |--------+-------------------------------------------|
   | =%l=     | maildir label                             |
   | =%n=     | number of "new" messages (ie. unread)     |
   | =%c=     | number of "current" messages (ie. seen)   |
   | =%t=     | number of "temporary" messages (ie. misc) |

   To add a Maildir, add it to the =*maildir-alist*= alist. The car or
   each item is it's label and the cdr it's pathname. Here's an example
   of how to add a custom directory.
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
	 (push (cons "Job" (realname "~/job-mail")) maildir:*maildir-alist*)
   #+END_SRC
   
   By default, only =~/Mail= is indexed. All directories that cannot be
   found, are ignored.
